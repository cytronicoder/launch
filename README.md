# Launch

This is a repository on how to solve problems (and maybe make some money off of them).

I based this work mostly on my summer experience at the inaugural [LaunchX Innovation Program.](https://www.launchx.com) I also added some of my own notes here after leading many projects, both in personal and educational settings.

I hope you find this helpful.
